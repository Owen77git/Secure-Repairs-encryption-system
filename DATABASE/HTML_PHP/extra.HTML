    <h2>🔧 Repair Tools and Their Roles</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>Diagnostic Software</h3>
      <p>
        Used to scan mobile devices for errors in operating systems, 
        performance, and configuration. Provides detailed reports on 
        faults for technicians to address. Helps prevent guesswork, 
        but must be controlled to avoid data snooping.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Firmware Flasher</h3>
      <p>
        Reinstalls or upgrades the phone’s operating system when corrupted. 
        Ensures proper system recovery and fixes persistent bugs. 
        Carries risk of unauthorized system modifications if misused, 
        hence client oversight is critical.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>USB Debugging Kit</h3>
      <p>
        Allows direct connection between device and technician computer. 
        Facilitates software repair, testing, and updates. 
        Useful for system-level fixes but also poses a backdoor risk 
        if used without proper logging.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Password Reset Tool</h3>
      <p>
        Used when clients forget lock patterns or PINs. 
        Grants technicians ability to bypass login barriers. 
        Must be strictly authorized to avoid privacy abuse, 
        since it gives full device access.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Data Recovery Software</h3>
      <p>
        Restores accidentally deleted or lost files. 
        Valuable for client satisfaction during repairs. 
        However, if misapplied, it may expose sensitive 
        personal files without consent.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Hardware Diagnostic Board</h3>
      <p>
        Specialized board for testing phone circuits and chips. 
        Identifies hardware faults such as charging or power failures. 
        Enhances repair accuracy but requires expert use. 
        Logs ensure no misuse of hardware access.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Battery Calibration Tool</h3>
      <p>
        Resets phone battery readings for accurate charging data. 
        Helps restore device power efficiency. 
        Prevents premature battery replacement, saving cost. 
        Safe when controlled but logs must confirm actions.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Screen Testing Tool</h3>
      <p>
        Detects touch sensitivity, dead pixels, and display faults. 
        Assists in validating screen replacements or repairs. 
        Prevents unnecessary hardware swaps. 
        Low risk but usage should still be tracked.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Network Unlock Tool</h3>
      <p>
        Removes carrier restrictions to allow SIM flexibility. 
        Offers freedom for clients changing networks. 
        Can be misused for illegal unlocking, so permission 
        must be explicitly given by clients.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Backup & Restore Utility</h3>
      <p>
        Backs up client files before repair and restores them afterward. 
        Ensures data preservation during risky procedures. 
        Crucial for integrity, but backups must be encrypted. 
        Protects both client trust and technician accountability.

  <!-- Additional Info -->
  <section class="additional">
    <h2>📌 Additional Information</h2>
    <p>
      According to the project milestones, all repair activities will be logged 
      with timestamps and encrypted to prevent tampering. Clients will be able to 
      permit or deny access rights, receive SMS/email notifications in real-time, 
      and download post-repair integrity reports. This ensures transparency, 
      accountability, and compliance with data protection policies.
