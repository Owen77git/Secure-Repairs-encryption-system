    <h1>Goal of the System</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Secure Repair System</strong> was developed to stop the
      <span class="highlight">mishandling of client data</span> in electronic repair shops.
      Too often, technicians have unauthorized access to photos, messages, and personal
      files during the repair process. This creates risks of <em>extortion, blackmail,
      and loss of trust</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our system introduces a <span class="highlight">secure monitoring framework</span>
      built on four principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Real-time CCTV Monitoring</strong> -watch repairs live to ensure transparency.</li>
      <li> <strong>Encrypted Repair Logs</strong> - every technician’s action is timestamped and tamper-proof.</li>
      <li> <strong>Client Notifications</strong> - instant SMS/email alerts when sensitive data is accessed.</li>
      <li> <strong>Technician Authentication</strong> - only authorized staff may use repair tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In short, the goal is to <strong>protect customer privacy, enforce accountability,
      and rebuild trust</strong> between clients and technicians.
